# RANDOM API

This project was developed as a learning exercise to enhance my proficiency in Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The focus was on core DRF concepts, including permissions, viewsets, routers, and basic CRUD operations. The application includes an API for user authentication, as well as two additional APIs for managing houses and tasks.
